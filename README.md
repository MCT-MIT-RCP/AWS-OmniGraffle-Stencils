AWS-OmniGraffle-Stencils
========================

If use OmniGraffle and AWS - these stencils are for you.

Omnigraffle compatible versions of the [AWS simple icons](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/).

Last updated using *AWS_Simple_Icons_EPS-SVG_v17.1.19*

# Steps

* Download the latest AWS icons and unzip into the same directory as `convert.sh`
* Install `epstopdf` from [CTAN](http://ctan.org/pkg/epstopdf)
* run `./convert.sh <unzipped AWS icons directory>`

Time passes, but you should find that you'll have just the converted PDF files left in the AWS icons directory.

* Manually add the PDF files to the stencil files.

Dull but works, drag and dropping the PDF files into a stencil template can be a bit hit and miss.  I've found the best way is to copy and paste in each icon, then group, name and add on the anchor points.

Dull, but handy.
