AWS-OmniGraffle-Stencils
========================

If use OmniGraffle and AWS - these stencils are for you.

Omnigraffle compatible versions of the [AWS simple icons](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/).

Last updated using *PNG,+SVG,+EPS_17.10.18.zip*

# Installing epstopdf

	brew cask install mactex
	
Then install the Ghostscript package from [MacTex packages](http://www.tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html)

# Steps

* Download the latest AWS icons and unzip into the same directory as `convert.sh`
* run `./convert.sh <unzipped AWS icons directory>`

Time passes, but you should find that you'll have just the converted PDF files left in the AWS icons directory.

* Manually add the PDF files to the stencil files.

Dull but works, drag and dropping the PDF files into a stencil template can be a bit hit and miss.  I've found the best way is to copy and paste in each icon, then group, name and add on the anchor points.

Dull, but handy.
